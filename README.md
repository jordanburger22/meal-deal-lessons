# React Learning Series: Project Overview

Welcome to the **React Learning Series**! This project is designed to introduce you to core React concepts through a step-by-step curriculum, covering everything from setting up your first React app to handling dynamic data and forms. Below is an overview of the lessons and topics you'll cover, each building upon the previous to provide a comprehensive introduction to React development.

---

### 1. **React Introduction**
   - **Why React?**: Discover the advantages of React and why it's a powerful tool for building modern web applications.
   - **Setting Up the React App**: Get your project started with tools like Vite or Scrimba to create a fast and simple development environment.
   - **React JSX**: Learn what JSX is and how it allows you to write HTML-like syntax directly within JavaScript, making UI creation intuitive and efficient.
   - **Intro to Components**: Discover why JSX alone can lead to large, monolithic files, and how **Components** solve this issue by breaking the UI into reusable pieces.

---

### 2. **React Components**
   - **What are Components?**: Understand the purpose and structure of components as the building blocks of React applications.
   - **Building and Rendering Components**: Learn how to create custom components and render them within your app.
   - **Styling with Classes**: Understand the difference between `class` and `className` in JSX, and learn how to style components with imported CSS files.
   - **Data Sharing Between Components**: Realize the need for sharing data across different components, setting the stage for the next lesson on Props.

---

### 3. **React Props**
   - **Introduction to Props**: Learn how props allow you to pass data from one component to another and solve the problem of isolated component data.
   - **Using Props**: Understand what’s happening “under the hood” when you pass props, and learn about destructuring for cleaner code.
   - **Mapping Data with Props**: See how to display lists of data by mapping over arrays and rendering JSX for each item.
   - **Keys and Nested Data**: Discover how to handle lists and nested data structures with props and avoid the common “key” warning by using unique identifiers.

---

### 4. **React Events**
   - **Event Handlers in React**: Learn how to handle events without the traditional `.addEventListener()` approach, using React’s streamlined `onClick` and other event listeners.
   - **Updating the UI with Events**: Identify the challenge of updating UI dynamically and set up for the concept of state management to solve it.

---

### 5. **React State**
   - **Intro to `useState`**: Learn about state as a means to track data that changes over time, and see how `useState` manages and updates these values within components.
   - **Updating State**: Discover how the setter function for `useState` works and how to conditionally change state using the ternary operator.
   - **Handling Complex State**: Learn how to store and manipulate complex data structures like arrays and objects in state.
   - **Conditional Rendering**: Master techniques for conditionally rendering JSX with state, using `&&` and the ternary (`? :`) operator.

---

### 6. **React Forms**
   - **React Forms and Input Handling**: Learn how to use state with forms and understand how `e.target` in `handleChange` provides access to form data.
   - **Form Submission**: Understand how to handle form submission with `onSubmit` on the form element, and see why it's attached to the form rather than the button.
   - **Handling Different Input Types**: Explore how to manage various input types (like checkboxes, text inputs, etc.) and learn the unique approach for checkboxes, which have a `checked` property.

---

### 7. **React `useEffect` and API Calls**
   - **API Calls and `useEffect`**: Learn how to handle side effects in React with `useEffect` and why it’s ideal for API requests, as well as controlling when these requests occur with the dependency array.
   - **Rendering API Data**: Store fetched API data in state and render it within the app to create a dynamic, data-driven interface.

---

### 8. **Edit and Delete Functionality**
   - **Delete Functionality**: Learn how to remove items from an array stored in state using `.filter()`, and practice conditional rendering with the ternary operator.
   - **Edit Functionality**: Discover how to edit items within arrays using `.map()` and see how React enables inline updates with ease.
   - **Putting It All Together**: Combine the skills from each lesson to create a cohesive app that allows adding, editing, and deleting data.

## Project Goals

By the end of this learning series, you will have a strong foundation in core React concepts and the ability to build functional, interactive components for modern web applications. You will also understand how to structure a React project, manage dynamic data, handle user input, and render complex, conditional UIs.
